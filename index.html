    </article>
    
    <p> My name is Matthew Roberts, I go by Matt or Matty. I was born on the 8<sup>th</sup> of January, 2001 in Ottawa. I am new to essentially everything associated with web development. I spend the majority of my time focusing on music which is my primary passion in life. I enjoy playing guitar, bass and used to spend a lot of my time focusing on the trumpet. I initially attended the <em>University of Toronto</em> for music performance.</p>

        Outside of music one of my interests is graphic design and working out. I'm hoping that I can use the skills that I aquire in web development to incorporate into my other interests. Being able to create a website for someone in the music industry is a positive networking tool. Learning the language of code is something that excites me greatly; it is an important form of communication that can take you wherever you want to go.
